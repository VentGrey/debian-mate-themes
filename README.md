# Disclaimer

I shall not receive any credit for this because work isn't mine, I just grabbed the Ubuntu MATE themes & rebranded them to fit Debian 11 Buster for personal use.


# Introduction

Debian is one of the most polished Gnu/Linux distributions out there, and it runs extremely well with a traditional desktop like MATE. Even though Debian is not known for being a super sketchy out of the box / newbie friendly distribution it doesn't mean that it's users can't have nice user interfaces, themed to their likings. I personally love the look and feel of Ubuntu MATE since I started using it a long time ago and decided I'll port that look and feel for Debian.

Since Debian 11 does not have the Ubuntu Humanity Icons, I decided to package these icons with most of it's dependencies included & I'll  also try to include wallpapers & other Ubuntu MATE stuff rebranded for Debian (As long as the license permits it)

If you want to cooperate you are free to.

# TODO List (Improvements)

Read the [issues tab](https://github.com/VentGrey/debian-mate-themes/issues)

# Dependencies
Most dependencies are already included, like Humanity Icon Theme + Ravefinity addons.

You might want to install the ubuntu fonts from the Debian repositories:

- On Debian 11: `$ sudo apt install fonts-ubuntu fonts-ubuntu-console`
- On Debian 10: Download from the [Official ubuntu font page](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/)

For a better user experience I recommend you to install these MATE packages:

```bash
$ sudo apt install ayatana-indicator-application ayatana-indicator-power ayatana-indicator-bluetooth ayatana-indicator-printers ayatana-indicator-common ayatana-indicator-session ayatana-indicator-datetime ayatana-indicator-sound ayatana-indicator-messages ayatana-settings ayatana-indicator-notifications ayatana-webmail mate-applets vala-panel-appmenu
```
